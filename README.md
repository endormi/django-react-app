# Django-React-App

**Backend**: Django (**2.1.7**)

**Frontend**: React.js (**3.0.1**)

**NGINX**: NGINX-proxy with Docker

## Running the server

You must have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.

```
docker-compose up
```

Build

```
docker-compose build
```

### Other option (for running the server)

If `docker-compose up` doesn't work for some reason, this is an additional way you can get this project to work.

The frontend and the backend has simple instructions. Remember that you have to have both running, so you will have to use two terminals.
