# Backend

The backend for this web application was built using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). This handles the database stuff related to this app and other needed backend stuff.

Currently the database that I use is sqlite3, but I might change it to PostgreSQL later on.

Run the server:

```
py manage.py runserver
```
